    <h1>The Sims Special</h1>
    
    <em>This week we’re tackling the weird and wonderful food from The Sims. 
        First on our list, Mac and Cheese. While seemingly simple, we couldn’t 
        resist putting our own spin on it. Next up, a *new* classic, the ultra comforting 
        Aubergine Parmesan (alternate identity: Eggplant Parm). And finally, 
        the ever-challenging Baked Alaska. The perfect summer dessert, best accompanied 
        by your household fire extinguisher.</em>
